Title:     "Date Accuracy Indicator"
Description: "The Date Accuracy Indicator code system defines concepts that indicate the accuracy of components of a reported date. The concepts defined in this code system are equivalent to those defined in the METeOR value domains for Date—accuracy indicator, code AAA (http://meteor.aihw.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/294429)."
